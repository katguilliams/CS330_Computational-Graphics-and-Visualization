# CS330_Computational-Graphics-and-Visualization

### 1. How do I approach designing software? ###

* #### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? ####
I learned how to code OpenGL in C++. In doing so, I learned how to take a rough 2D image and turn it into a 3D model using back-end coding. Creating a triangle and turning it into a square and then to a rectangle, then turning that rectangle into a 3D figure of itself. 

* #### What design process did you follow for your project work? ####
I worked on one piece of my image at a time. I started with what I thought would be the most difficult, plotting out the Cricut machine on a 3D graph (hand-drawn). Then I took those plotted points and learned how to create triangles from them to turn it into a rectangle in code. For example, a 2D rectangle is made of two triangles that share a side. The 3D Cricut image contains six sides, so I needed to learn how to plot twelve triangles that corresponded with one another and connected appropriately. Graphing the points out first was helpful as I could label each plotted point and refer to them as such. Example, point A is plotted at (-1.75, -1, 0). This being (x, y, z) plot points on a 3D graph. From there I was able to refer to point A as point A so when I needed to create a side for the rectangle, I noted point A, B, C, and D. This also helped me recognize what sides connected to each other as point A started as the bottom side of the rectangle and a connecting point for the back side and the right side of the Cricut machine.
I used this same method throughout the project for each item.

### 2. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? ###

* #### How do I approach developing programs? ####
I like to draw out the plan for the program first before I start developing. This way I have every idea laid out in front of me and can work off it as a planned outcome while making changes along the way to better the program.

* #### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? ####
I learned how to plan out my 3D Scene before beginning my code. I took a picture of my 2D scene to turn into a 3D scene and plotted out where I wanted my items to sit on a plane, along with plotting the plane the items sit on. Working one item at a time, I learned how to change the color of each item, have a texture on different items, and how to rotate the camera to be able to view the 3D Scene better.

* #### How did iteration factor into your development? ####
A lot of my code was repeated. For example, to create a 2D rectangle I plotted points A, B, C, C, D, and A. This being two triangles: A, B, and C then C, D, and A. C and A were repeated in this line of code to create the triangles and connect them to each other to create the 2D rectangle. This is the same for each side of the 3D rectangle, just at different plotted points.

* #### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion? ####
I continued to focus on one or two add-ons during each milestone to help me reach the completion of my project.

### 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? ###

* #### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? ####
Now that I know how to use OpenGL C++ to create a window with a 3D model inside of it, I know that I can use these skills in my future classes as C++ will be a continued coding language throughout my courses.

* #### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? ####
These skills I learned can help me in future projects during my profession and show my employer of what I am capable.
